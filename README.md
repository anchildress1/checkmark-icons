# checkmark-icons

> 🦄 Well, it started out as an easy way to store icons publicly for a project I was working on, but it has since grown into a small collection of various things across unrelated projects. So here we are. My personal icon repository, random images, logos, color palettes, and anything else I feel like throwing in here. At least up until GitHub decides I've exceeded my storage limit. 😆
