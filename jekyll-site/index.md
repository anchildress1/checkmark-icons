## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll ships with Markdown support, collections, layouts, and Liquid templating. This demo shows how a GitHub Pages deployment can build the site in CI while keeping the output alongside other deploy variants.

### Highlights

- Markdown-to-HTML compilation handled automatically
- Themeable layouts using the `minima` starter
- Content-aware navigation and posts if you add `_posts/`

> Tip: this site is built from the `jekyll-site/` folder and published to the `/jekyll` subdirectory of the live Pages site.
